# Jamboree-Case-Study
<h1>Project Overview</h1>
Jamboree is a renowned educational institution that has successfully assisted numerous students in gaining admission to top colleges abroad. With their proven problem-solving methods, they have helped students
achieve exceptional scores on exams like GMAT, GRE, and SAT with minimal effort.
<br>
<br>
To further support students, Jamboree has recently introduced a new feature on their website. This feature enables students to assess their probability of admission to Ivy League colleges, considering the unique
perspective of Indian applicants.
<br>
<br>
By conducting a thorough analysis, we can assist Jamboree in understanding the crucial factors impacting graduate admissions and their interrelationships. Additionally, we can provide predictive insights to determine an individual's admission chances based on various variables.

<h1>Insights and Recomendations</h1>
<br>
<h3>Insights</h3><br>
- The distributions of different features indicate that students of diverse merit levels applied to the university.<br><br>
- Individuals with higher GRE scores tend to also achieve higher TOEFL scores. This correlation is reasonable, as both tests include a verbal section. While these sections are not identical, they share similarities that make this relationship understandable.<br><br>
- Individuals with higher CGPA generally tend to have higher GRE scores. This may be attributed to their intelligence or diligent work habits.<br><br>
- LORs are not strongly correlated with CGPA, indicating that a person's LOR is not necessarily dependent on their academic performance. Typically, having research experience is associated with obtaining a strong LOR. This can be explained by the personal interactions between supervisors and students involved in research, which often lead to favorable LORs.<br><br>
- GRE scores and LORs do not exhibit a strong correlation. Individuals with varying levels of LORs can have a wide range of GRE scores.<br><br>
- CGPA and SOP do not show a strong correlation because, while the Statement of Purpose is related to academic performance, individuals with high CGPA are generally more hardworking and thus have positive content
in their SOPs. This might explain the slight tendency for higher CGPA to be associated with better SOPs.<br><br>
- Low correlation between TOEFL score and SOP<br><br>
- Following features are highly correlated<br><br>
1.GRE Score & TOEFL Score<br>
2.GRE Score & CGPA<br>
3.GRE Score & Chance of Admit<br>
4.TOEFL Score & CGPA<br>
5.TOEFL Score & Chance of Admit<br>
6.University Rating & SOP<br>
7.CGPA & Chance of Admit<br><br>
- While checking assumptions of linear regression the value of Mean of Residual is -0.00573<br><br>
- The data does not have Heteroscedasticity.<br><br>
- Residuals follows normal distribution.<br><br>
- the graph of predicted value vs tested values does not follow proper linear trend<br><br>
- Mean Squared Error (MSE) for linear regression model is 0.00453<br><br>
- Adjusted R-squared value for linear regression model is 0.73587<br><br>
- To increase the R-squared value polynomial regression were used and the R-squared value for it is 0.81168<br><br>

<h3>Recomendations</h3>
<br>
 <b>Prioritize CGPA</b>: Encourage students to prioritize maintaining a high CGPA throughout their academic journey. They should aim to excel in their coursework, assignments, and examinations to achieve a competitive
CGPA. Emphasize the importance of consistent academic performance as it serves as a primary indicator of an applicant's academic ability and potential for success in graduate studies. 
<br>
<br>
 <b>Focus on Achieving Competitive GRE and TOEFL Scores after CGPA:</b> After CGPA, GRE and TOEFL scores are identified as significant factors for admission. Students should allocate sufficient time and resources to
prepare for these standardized tests. Recommend engaging in structured study plans, practice tests, and seeking guidance from tutors or preparatory courses to improve performance in these exams. Emphasize the
importance of attaining competitive scores to strengthen their candidacy for admission.
<br>
<br>
 <b>Engage in Research Activities: </b>Participation in research activities, including writing research papers, significantly enhances the likelihood of admission. Encourage students to actively seek opportunities to engage in research projects, collaborate with faculty members, and contribute to research publications. Research involvement not only demonstrates academic curiosity and intellectual rigor but also showcases an applicant's ability to contribute to the scholarly community.
<br><br>
 <b>Allocate Less Emphasis on the Statement of Purpose (SOP) Compared to Other Factors:</b> While the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is an essential component of the application, it is identified as the least important
factor for admission. Advise students to craft a well-written SOP that reflects their academic aspirations, relevant experiences, and alignment with the program objectives. However, emphasize that while the SOP should not be overlooked, greater emphasis should be placed on factors such as CGPA, GRE, TOEFL scores, and research engagement when preparing their application.
